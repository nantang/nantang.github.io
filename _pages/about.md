Associate Prof. and PG Coordinator: <a href="http://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/">Data Science and Analytics Thrust</a>
<br>
Associate Dean (PG Affairs): <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/">Information Hub</a>
<br>
University Senate Member: <a href="http://hkust-gz.edu.cn/">HKUST(Guangzhou)</a>

I also hold an affiliated position at <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>, the Clear Water Bay campus at Hong Kong.
Before joining HKUST(GZ), I worked as a senior scientist at <a href="https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri/about">Qatar Computing Research Institute</a>, a visiting scientist at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a>, a research fellow at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>, a scientific staff member at <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/en/">CWI</a> (national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands), and a visiting scholar at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.


I am directing the <a href="https://github.com/HKUSTDial"> Data Intelligence and Analytics Lab (DIAL)</a>. I am currently focusing on the following projects: 

<ul>
  <li>
    <em><strong>Document-to-Database: Unlocking Structured Insights from Documents.</strong></em>
    Transform unstructured documents (PDFs, reports, emails) into structured database tables so that analytics, joins, and queries operate directly over derived schemas—bridging document-centric content and tabular analytics at scale.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em><strong>Document AI: From Pages to Purpose-Built Intelligence.</strong></em>
    Leverage AI (vision, NLP, layout, semantics) to ingest, understand and operationalize documents in business workflows—e.g., extracting structured entities, linking documents, automating decision-flows—so documents become active assets, not inert files.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em><strong>Agent Memory for Data-Analytic Tasks: Enabling Persistent Reasoning.</strong></em>
    Build memory systems for data-analytic agents so they accumulate experiences, recall prior analyses and reasoning chains, and maintain context across multi-step workflows—enabling agents to “remember” prior tables, joins, corrections, and meta-decisions..
  </li>
  <li>
    <em><strong>DeepFund: Real-Time Multi-Agent LLM in Finance.</strong></em>
    The DeepFund platform by Paradoox AI brings together live market data, multi-agent LLMs (analysts & portfolio managers), and real-time evaluation—moving beyond back-testing to assess LLMs in real investment scenarios with built-in risk/control semantics.
  </li>
</ul>
