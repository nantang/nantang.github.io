I am an associate professor at <a href="http://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/">Data Science and Analytics Thrust</a>, <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/">Information Hub</a>, <a href="http://hkust-gz.edu.cn/">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>. 

Before joining HKUST(GZ), I worked as a senior scientist at <a href="https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri/about">Qatar Computing Research Institute</a>, a visiting scientist at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a>, a research fellow at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>, a scientific staff member at <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/en/">CWI</a> (national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands), and a visiting scholar at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.


I am directing the <a href=""> Data Intelligence</a> lab, which focuses on finding good data and smart analytics that are fundamental to data management, data science and artificial intelligence. 

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Retrieval-based language models using multi-modal data lakes.</b> 
    Data lakes have become increasingly popular for many organizations. Given a natural language question, retrieving datasets (e.g., text, tables, graphs) and reasoning with language models are key for business intelligence.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Good data for AI (a.k.a. data-centric AI).</b> 
    For most machine learning practitioners, the success of machine learning projects heavily depends on whether we can find good data for model training.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>AI for good data.</b> 
    Data scientists spend at least 80% of their time on data preparation. Machine learning models can help address diverse data preparation challenges.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Visualization.</b> 
    Data visualization is important to data analytics. I am working on automatic visualization, visualization recommendation, chat-to-story, chat-to-video, and visualization using AR/VR devices.
