Data visualization is invaluable for explaining the significance of data to people who are visually oriented. The central task of automatic data visualization is, given a dataset,
to visualize its compelling stories by transforming the data (e.g., selecting attributes, grouping and binning values) and deciding the right type of visualization (e.g., bar or line charts).

We study how to automatically visualize data and recommend visualizations to users.
