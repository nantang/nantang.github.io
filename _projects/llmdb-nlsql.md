NL2SQL (Natural Language to Structured Query Language) translation is a task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves automatically converting natural language queries into SQL queries. This technology is used in database management systems to enable users to interact with databases using natural language queries instead of having to learn SQL. NL2SQL translation involves several sub-tasks, including natural language understanding, semantic parsing, and query generation. The ultimate goal of NL2SQL is to produce an accurate SQL query that accurately reflects the user's intent and retrieves the desired information from the database.
