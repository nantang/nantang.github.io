Data matching generally refers to the process of deciding whether two data elements are the “same” (a.k.a. a match) or not, where each data element could be of different classes such as string, tuple, column, and so on. Data matching is a key concept in data integration and data preparation  that includes a wide spectrum of tasks. In this paper, we consider seven common data matching tasks, namely entity matching, entity linking, entity alignment, string matching, column type annotation, schema matching, and ontology matching.
