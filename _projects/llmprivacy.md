I am working with Flomesh on the
<a href="https://github.com/flomesh-io/zt4mcp"> zt4mcp </a> project, which is:

- A universal MCP Client capable of running on various devices and platforms, including PCs, mobile phones, IoT devices, servers, and cloud VPCs.
- A framework for rapid AI application development, with the built-in chat tool serving as a prime example.
- A simple and easy-to-use Zero Trust framework that provides an end-to-end secure AI runtime environment.

It is a framework for AI application developers and runtime, it provides a robust framework and a set of tools to ensure that every interaction within an MCP ecosystem is explicitly verified, access is granted on a least-privilege basis, and a breach is always assumed. It enable developers and organizations to confidently leverage the full power of MCP by:

- Enhancing Security Posture: Implementing granular access controls, strong authentication, and continuous authorization for all MCP clients, servers, and tools.
- Mitigating Risks: Protecting against known MCP vulnerabilities such as tool manipulation, unauthorized data access, and malicious command execution.
- Fostering Trustworthy AI: Building a safer environment for AI agents to operate, interact with data, and execute tasks.
- Promoting Secure Adoption: Providing a practical and accessible Zero Trust solution to encourage the secure development and deployment of MCP-enabled applications.
